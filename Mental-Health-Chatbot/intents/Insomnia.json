            "Develop a consistent sleep schedule: \nGo to bed and wake up at the same time each day, even on weekends. This helps regulate your body\u0027s natural sleep-wake cycle.\n\nCreate a relaxing bedtime routine:\n Wind down for an hour before bed with calming activities like reading, taking a warm bath, or listening to soothing music. Avoid stimulating activities like watching TV or using electronic devices.\n\nOptimize your sleep environment:\n Make sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, cool, and clutter-free. Invest in blackout curtains, earplugs, and a comfortable mattress and pillows.\n\nLimit caffeine and alcohol:\n Avoid caffeine intake in the afternoon and evening, as it can interfere with sleep. Limit alcohol consumption, as it may disrupt sleep quality later in the night.\n\nExercise regularly: \nPhysical activity can improve sleep quality, but avoid strenuous workouts close to bedtime.\n\nRelaxation techniques: \nPractice deep breathing exercises, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation before bed to calm your mind and body."
