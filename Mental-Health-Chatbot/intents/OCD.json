            "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):\n This is considered the first-line treatment for OCD and focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to the disorder.\n\n Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP):\n This type of therapy involves gradually exposing oneself to feared triggers while resisting the urge to perform compulsions.\n\n Medication:\n Medication, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), can be helpful in reducing OCD symptoms alongside therapy."
