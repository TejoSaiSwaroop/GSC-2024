            "Identify Your Emotional Distress: \nUnderstand what’s causing your distress. Once you identify the source, you can work on addressing it.\n\nAccept Your Emotional Experience: \nIn times of stress, it’s often easy to spend a lot of time resisting the reality of your feelings. Accepting your emotional experience is the first step toward coping with it.\n\nKeep an Emotional Toolkit on Hand:\n In a moment of distress, you may feel so overwhelmed that you temporarily forget your coping strategies. Having a toolkit of strategies can help.\n\nAdd in Gentle Movement:\n Physical activity, like a short walk or gentle yoga, can help reduce emotional distress.\n\nSeek Professional Help:\n If your emotional distress is persistent or hard to manage, consider contacting a doctor or mental health professional."
