            "Think Before You Speak:\n In the heat of the moment, it‚Äôs easy to say something you‚Äôll later regret. Take a few moments to collect your thoughts before saying anything.\n\n\nExpress Your Concerns Calmly: \nOnce you‚Äôre calm, express your frustration in an assertive but nonconfrontational way.\n\nExercise Regularly:\nPhysical activity can help reduce stress that can cause you to become angry.\n\nTake a Timeout:\n Give yourself short breaks during times of the day that tend to be stressful.\n\nIdentify Possible Solutions:\n Instead of focusing on what made you mad, work on resolving the issue at hand.\n\nUse ‚ÄòI‚Äô Statements: \nTo avoid criticizing or placing blame, use ‚ÄúI‚Äù statements to describe the problem.\n\nDon‚Äôt Hold a Grudge:\n Forgiveness is a powerful tool. If you allow anger and other negative feelings to crowd out positive feelings, you might find yourself swallowed up by your own bitterness or sense of injustice.\n\nUse Humor to Release Tension:\n Lightening up can help diffuse tension. Use humor to help you face what‚Äôs making you angry and, possibly, any unrealistic expectations you have for how things should go.\n\nPractice Relaxation Skills: \nDeep breathing, visualization, and yoga can help.\n\nSeek Professional Help: If your anger feels out of control, consider seeking help from a mental health professional. üòä"
