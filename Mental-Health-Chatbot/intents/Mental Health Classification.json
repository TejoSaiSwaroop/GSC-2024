            "Diagnosis: \nThis method uses criteria from manuals like the DSM-5 to categorize mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety. It’s useful for identifying and treating symptoms but doesn’t cover all aspects of mental well-being.\n\nContinuum: \nThis approach sees mental health as a spectrum from well-being to severe illness. It considers emotional, psychological, and social well-being, emphasizing the promotion of positive mental health.\n\nFunctional Impact: \nThis method focuses on how mental health affects daily life and quality of life, assessing the severity of mental health challenges and the need for intervention."
